# Build 🏗️

Run the repository and complete the following:

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #1 — Building and serving your LangGraph Agent Graph
  - Task 1: Getting Dependencies & Environment
    - Configure `.env` (OpenAI, Tavily, optional LangSmith)
  - Task 2: Serve the Graph Locally
    - `uv run langgraph dev` (API on http://localhost:2024)
  - Task 3: Call the API from a different terminal
    - `uv run test_served_graph.py` (sync SDK example)
  - Task 4: Explore assistants (from `langgraph.json`)
    - `agent` → `simple_agent` (tool-using agent)
    - `agent_helpful` → `agent_with_helpfulness` (separate helpfulness node)

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #2 — Using LangGraph Studio to visualize the graph
  - Task 1: Open Studio while the server is running
    - https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:2024
  - Task 2: Visualize & Stream
    - Start a run and observe node-by-node updates
  - Task 3: Compare Flows
    - Contrast `agent` vs `agent_helpful` (tool calls vs helpfulness decision)

## Activities and Questions 🏗️ &❓

#### ❓ Question 1:

Compare the `agent` and `agent_helpful` assistants defined in `langgraph.json`. Where does the helpfulness evaluator fit in the graph, and under what condition should execution route back to the agent vs. terminate?

##### ✅ Answer:
> Where does the helpfulness evaluator fit in the graph

The helpfulness node is reached from the agent node, when the last AI message has no tool_calls. 

> and under what condition should execution route back to the agent vs. terminate?

It routes back to the agent when the last message does not contain "HELPFULNESS:Y" and there is no "HELPFULNESS:END" marker. Thi is when the evaluator wasn’t confident it was helpful. It terminates when the last message is "HELPFULNESS:END"/the loop limit or it contains "HELPFULNESS:Y".

#### 🏗️ Activity #1 Debugging A Graph

Select the `agent_with_helpfulness` and set one or more interrupts (at least one `Before` and one `After`). Try changing values and continuing the turn. 

#### ❓ Question 2:

What are your thoughts on when you would use a Before interrupt vs. an After interrupt?

##### ✅ Answer:
Use a Before interrupt to pause just before a node executes so you can inspect/modify its incoming state or inputs (e.g., adjust the agent prompt or tool arguments) and influence routing. Use an After interrupt to pause right after a node runs to review its outputs (model reply, tool results, or a decision like HELPFULNESS:Y/END) and optionally override the next edge or terminate/continue.

I altered the response using the After interrupt in the helpfulness node.
