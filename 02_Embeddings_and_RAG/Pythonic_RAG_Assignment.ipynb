            "Response: The \"Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem\" refers to a situation where a CEO, who used to be strong in a particular function (e.g., product management, sales, marketing), hires a weak executive to run that same function after moving up to the CEO role. This often happens because the CEO has difficulty letting go of the function that brought them success (\"the function that brought him to the party\") and wants to remain \"the man\" in that area. The problem is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who himself was a brilliant TV network executive but, after buying ABC, hired executive leadership that was weak and caused ABC to fall to fourth place. Eisner expressed a desire to personally turn around ABC but did not have the time, illustrating the problem of not delegating effectively to strong executives in the CEO's former specialty (Source 1).\n",

            "A vector database is a specialized database system designed to store, index, and query high-dimensional vector data efficiently. Unlike traditional databases that work with structured data like numbers and strings, vector databases are optimized for similarity search operations on dense vector representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning in a mathematical format. They have become important due to the rise of AI applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems, which generate these embeddings. Key characteristics of vector databases include support for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, horizontal scalability, and integration with machine learning pipelines. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, and Qdrant. (Source 1, Page 1; Source 3, Page 1)\n",
