People are cashing in on AI by tapping into its brainpower as an **advisor and research sidekick** rather than just letting it crank out tasks like a robot. This means AI is leveling up knowledge-heavy gigs by boosting decision-making quality. So instead of AI simply **doing your job**, it’s making *you* sharper, savvier, and way more productive — that’s where the 💰 flows in.\\n\\nCollis and Brynjolfsson (2025) drop a bombshell: the extra value Americans get from generative AI usage is like a mind-blowing $97 billion *annual* surplus. Why? Because AI enhances worker output by **supporting smarter decisions** in work that’s all about knowledge hustle — think analysts, strategists, creators, advisors — AI’s your go-to wingman.\\n\\nIn short, the money hustle is not just outsourcing grunt work to AI; it’s **juicing up human brainpower** to make killer calls, innovate, and produce way more bang for their buck. That’s the fresh economic flex of AI making bank: augmenting the human grind with AI-powered wisdom. Boom.'"
